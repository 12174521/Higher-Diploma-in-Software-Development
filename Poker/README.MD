# A SIMPLE POKER GAME

For each round of poker, you and the computer are dealt a hand. You then decide if you, or the dealer(computer), can, and want to “open” the game. If one of you does so,  1 token goes “into the pot”. 

You can specify the cards you would like to re-fresh in your hand (to a maximum of 4). Likewise the dealer can refresh their hand, up to four cards.

After that, you can bet a number of tokens (0-3) and the computer can decide to let you win or ‘see’ your cards. If it lets you win, you get all the tokens in the pot. If it ‘sees you’, then it matches your bet and the best hand wins, taking all the tokens ‘in the pot’.

The game ends when the (non-computer) player decides it does or when one of the players has lost all their tokens.

The winning order of hands in poker is:
A royal flush (a straight flush starting at Ace and going down through King, Queen, Jack, to Ten)
A straight flush (a straight but all in the same suit – the higher the better)
Four of a kind (the higher the better)
A flush (all the same suit - the higher the better)
A straight (for example “4 clubs, 5 spades, 6 clubs, 7 diamond, 8 spades” - the higher the better)
A full house (triplets and a pair - the higher the triplets, the better)
Triplets (the higher the better)
2 pairs (the higher the better)
1 pair (the higher the better) 

To ‘open you need a pair of jacks or better in the above list.
