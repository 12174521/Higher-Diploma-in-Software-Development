# This	project	is an	online	dating	agency with	basic	functionality	
	
Project	Overview

The	key	functionality	is	as	follows:

 -  Allow	users	to	register	and	describe	themselves	in	a	profile.	The	
description	should	contain	traits	such	as	interests,	description,	seeking,	
etc.

 - Allow	users	to	connect,	by	sending	a	message	to	other	users	that	they	
are	interested.

 - Allow	users	to	browse other	users	(e.g.	show	all	users of	a	particular	
type,	e.g.	all	male	users).

 - Allow	registered	users	to	perform	searches on	other	users	(e.g.	list	all	
women	over	31 with	a	particular	hobby).

 - Suggest potential	matches	for	users.	For	example,	automatically	select	
the	users	from	the	 site	that	best	match	a	user	(based	on	the	userâ€™s	
interests,	etc.)	 and	show	these	matches	when	the	user	logs	in;
 - There	is	a	site for the	administrator who	can	delete	or	temporarily	ban	
users,	remove	abusive	or	offensive	vacancy	ads	and	edit	all	profiles	(both	
organization	and	user).

 - There is a statistics page that displays usage of the website for the admininstrator
